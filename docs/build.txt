Before first build update git submodules with:
git submodule update --init --recursive

or clone whole repo with --recursive option:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kicer86/photobroom.git


Required tools and libraries:
 - cmake - version 3.16 or later
 - Qt6 - version 6.0 or higher
 - exiv2*
 - dlib*
 - magic_enum*

 Optional libraries:
 - KCrash + drkonqi (for crash catching)

 Packages, libraries and other components kept as git submodules:
 - https://github.com/Kicer86/cmake_modules.git                 - various cmake modules and package finders
 - https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition_models.git      - modules for face recognition
 - git://anongit.kde.org/kwidgetsaddons.git                     - kdewidgets
 - https://github.com/Kicer86/github_api.git                    - github api

* For convenience it is possible to use vcpkg tool
  for download, build and install all marked libraries.


vcpkg setup:
vcpkg install dlib[core,cuda,fftw3] exiv2 magic-enum qtbase qtquickcontrols2 qtsvg qttools

In case you do not want vcpkg to download and build Qt6
because it is available in your system, do not include qtbase qtquickcontrols2, qtsvg and qttools ports.

If your system does not have NVidia GPU, use dlib[core,fftw3] instead of dlib[core,cuda,fftw3] in vcpkg call.


Tested compilers (with c++20 support):
1. gcc (Linux and Windows)
2. clang (Linux)
3. Visual Studio 2019 (Windows)


PhotoBroom cannot be run without installation step.
Build 'install' target to install PhotoBroom.
On Windows photo broom can be launched from installation dir only.
On Linux, thanks to RPATH, it can be launched from build dir.

Extra targets available for Windows:
'deploy'  prepares extra dir with all external dependencies required by PhotoBroom.
'package' target will create a package (Installator) with all files required for running
          PhotoBroom on other Windows machines.
